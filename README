Muggu (in Telugu) or Rangoli is an Indian pattern art which follows drawing lines connecting points inside a grid of points. The patterns are made during festive days, and filled with colors. This is an attempt to generate such patterns.

The first assumption is to ignore the grid points. Instead make a fine continuous plane, and create a symmetric pattern generator. As a kid I loved playing with a spirograph. This is what I will try here. 

I realized that a spirograph is just a pendulum in zerogravity on a plane. [Also defies the motion of Sun-Earth-Moon system(?)] We are tracing the position of the 'bob' of the pendulum. In the case of a single pendulum, we get a circle. Now attaching another pendulum to the bob of the previous pendulum would result in interesting patterns. And so on ...

The angular rotation of each pedulum is dependent on its predecessor. This accounts for no slipping between the circles of the spirograph.

Pendulum is a python class wherein the pivot of the pendulum can be changed. This enabled perpetual addition of pendulums to one another.

ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE:
1) numpy
2) matplotlib

TO RUN:
>python muggu.py 
>python pendulum.py 

FUTURE:

To snap the smooth curves into the grid points.

What happens in 3D? what regulates the motion along each direction. Are atomic orbitals 3D Spirographs?
 - Probably not, but I wonder.
